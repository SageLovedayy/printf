# Custom `printf` Implementation in C

## Description

This repository contains a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C programming language. The `printf` function is a powerful tool for formatted output, and this implementation provides a simplified version for educational purposes and customization.

## Features

- **Basic Formatting:** Support for `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, and other basic format specifiers.
- **Variable Arguments:** Handle a variable number of arguments.
- **Buffering:** Implement buffering techniques for efficient output handling.
- **Customization:** Easy to customize and extend for specific formatting needs.

## Usage

To use the custom `printf` function in your C program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SageLovedayy/printf.git
    ```

2. Include the `main.h` header file in your C file:

    ```c
    #include "main.h"
    ```

3. Call the `_printf` function with the desired format and arguments:

    ```c
    _printf("Hello, %s! The answer is %d.\n", "World", 42);
    ```

4. Compile your program with the custom `printf` implementation:

    ```bash
    gcc -o my_program my_program.c _printf.c -Wall -Wextra -std=c99
    ```

5. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the `_printf` function according to your specific requirements. You can modify the format specifiers, implement additional features, or optimize the buffering strategy.
